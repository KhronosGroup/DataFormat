Compressed texture images stored using the S3TC compressed image formats
are represented as a collection of latexmath:[$4\times 4$] texel blocks, where each block
contains 64 or 128 bits of texel data.  The image is encoded as a normal
2D raster image in which each latexmath:[$4\times 4$] block is treated as a single pixel.
If an S3TC image has a width or height that is not a multiple of four, the
data corresponding to texels outside the image are irrelevant and
undefined.

When an S3TC image with a width of _w_, height of _h_, and block size of
_blocksize_ (8 or 16 bytes) is decoded, the corresponding image size (in
bytes) is:

[latexmath]
++++++++++++++++
\begin{align*}
\left\lceil { w \over 4 } \right\rceil \times
\left\lceil { h \over 4 } \right\rceil \times
blocksize
\end{align*}
++++++++++++++++

When decoding an S3TC image, the block containing the texel at offset
latexmath:[$(x,y)$] begins at an offset (in bytes) relative to the base of the
image of:

[latexmath]
++++++++++++++
\begin{align*}
blocksize \times
 \left( { \left\lceil  { w \over 4 } \right\rceil \times
          \left\lfloor { y \over 4 } \right\rfloor +
          \left\lfloor { x \over 4 } \right\rfloor } \right)
\end{align*}
++++++++++++++

The data corresponding to a specific texel latexmath:[$(x,y)$] are extracted from a
latexmath:[$4\times 4$] texel block using a relative latexmath:[$(x,y)$] value of

[latexmath]
++++++++++++++
\begin{align*}
(x \bmod 4,y \bmod 4)
\end{align*}
++++++++++++++

There are four distinct S3TC image formats:

=== BC1 with no alpha

Each latexmath:[$4 \times 4$] block of texels consists of 64
bits of RGB image data.

Each RGB image data block is encoded as a sequence of 8 bytes, called (in
order of increasing address):

[latexmath]
++++++
\begin{align*}
c0_{lo}, c0_{hi}, c1_{lo}, c1_{hi}, bits_0, bits_1, bits_2, bits_3
\end{align*}
++++++

The 8 bytes of the block are decoded into three quantities:

[latexmath]
++++++
\begin{align*}
color_0 & = c0_{lo} + c0_{hi} \times 256 \\
color_1 & = c1_{lo} + c1_{hi} \times 256 \\
bits    & = bits_0 + 256 \times (bits_1 + 256 \times (bits_2 + 256 \times bits_3))
\end{align*}
++++++

_color0_ and _color1_ are 16-bit unsigned integers that
are unpacked to RGB colors RGB0 and RGB1 as though they were 16-bit packed pixels with
the R channel in the high 5 bits, G in the next 6 bits and B in the low 5 bits.

_bits_ is a 32-bit unsigned integer, from which a two-bit control code
is extracted for a texel at location latexmath:[$(x,y)$] in the block using:

[latexmath]
++++++
\begin{align*}
code(x,y) & = bits[2\times (4\times y+x)+1\ \dots\ 2\times(4\times y+x)+0]
\end{align*}
++++++

where bit 31 is the most significant and bit 0 is the least
significant bit.

The RGB color for a texel at location latexmath:[$(x,y)$] in the block is given
in <<BC1blocks>>.

^| BLACK | latexmath:[$color_0 \le color_1$] and latexmath:[$code(x,y) = 3$]
|==========

Arithmetic operations are done per component, and BLACK refers to an
RGB color where red, green, and blue are all zero.

Since this image has an RGB format, there is no alpha component and the
image is considered fully opaque.


=== BC1 with alpha

Each latexmath:[$4\times 4$] block of texels consists of 64
bits of RGB image data and minimal alpha information.  The RGB components
of a texel are extracted in the same way as BC1 with no alpha.

The alpha component for a texel at location latexmath:[$(x,y)$] in the block is
given by <<BC1alpha>>.

// This is a discussion of the behavior of the encoder, not of the
// format itself.
//
// IMPORTANT:  When encoding an RGBA image into a format using 1-bit
// alpha, any texels with an alpha component less than 0.5 end up with an
// alpha of 0.0 and any texels with an alpha component greater than or
// equal to 0.5 end up with an alpha of 1.0.  When encoding an RGBA image
// into the COMPRESSED_RGBA_S3TC_DXT1_EXT format, the resulting red,
// green, and blue components of any texels with a final alpha of 0.0
// will automatically be zero (black).  If this behavior is not desired
// by an application, it should not use COMPRESSED_RGBA_S3TC_DXT1_EXT.
// This format will never be used when a generic compressed internal
// format (Table 3.16.2) is specified, although the nearly identical
// format COMPRESSED_RGB_S3TC_DXT1_EXT (above) may be.

The red, green, and blue components of any texels with a final alpha
of 0 should be encoded as zero (black).

=== BC2

Each latexmath:[$4\times 4$] block of texels consists of 64
bits of uncompressed alpha image data followed by 64 bits of RGB image
data.

Each RGB image data block is encoded according to the
BC1 formats, with the exception that the two code
bits always use the non-transparent encodings.  In other words, they are
treated as though color0 > color1, regardless of the actual values of
color0 and color1.

Each alpha image data block is encoded as a sequence of 8 bytes, called
(in order of increasing address):

[latexmath]
++++++
\begin{align*}
a_0, a_1, a_2, a_3, a_4, a_5, a_6, a_7
\end{align*}
++++++

The 8 bytes of the block are decoded into one 64-bit integer:

[latexmath]
++++++
\begin{align*}
alpha & = a_0 + 256 \times (a_1 + 256 \times (a_2 + 256 \times (a_3 +
                   256 \times (a_4 + 256 \times (a_5 + 256 \times (a_6 + 256 \times a_7))))))
\end{align*}
++++++

_alpha_ is a 64-bit unsigned integer, from which a four-bit alpha value
is extracted for a texel at location latexmath:[$(x,y)$] in the block using:

[latexmath]
++++++
\begin{align*}
alpha(x,y) & = bits[4\times(4\times y+x)+3 \dots 4\times(4\times y+x)+0]
\end{align*}
++++++

where bit 63 is the most significant and bit 0 is the least
significant bit.

The alpha component for a texel at location latexmath:[$(x,y)$] in the block is
given by latexmath:[$alpha(x,y)\over 15$].

=== BC3

Each latexmath:[$4\times 4$] block of texels consists of 64
bits of compressed alpha image data followed by 64 bits of RGB image data.

Each RGB image data block is encoded according to the
BC1 formats, with the exception that the two code
bits always use the non-transparent encodings.  In other words, they are
treated as though color0 > color1, regardless of the actual values of
color0 and color1.

Each alpha image data block is encoded as a sequence of 8 bytes, called
(in order of increasing address):

[latexmath]
++++++
\begin{align*}
alpha_0, alpha_1, bits_0, bits_1, bits_2, bits_3, bits_4, bits_5
\end{align*}
++++++

The latexmath:[$alpha_0$] and latexmath:[$alpha_1$] are 8-bit unsigned bytes converted to alpha
components by multiplying by latexmath:[$1\over 255$].

The 6 _bits_ bytes of the block are decoded into one 48-bit integer:

[latexmath]
++++++
\begin{align*}
bits & = bits_0 + 256 \times (bits_1 + 256 \times (bits_2 +
           256 \times (bits_3 + 256 \times (bits_4 + 256 \times bits_5))))
\end{align*}
++++++

_bits_ is a 48-bit unsigned integer, from which a three-bit control code
is extracted for a texel at location latexmath:[$(x,y)$] in the block using:

[latexmath]
++++++
\begin{align*}
code(x,y) & = bits[3\times(4\times y+x)+2 \dots 3\times(4\times y+x)+0]
\end{align*}
++++++

where bit 47 is the most-significant and bit 0 is the least-significant bit.

The alpha component for a texel at location latexmath:[$(x,y)$] in the block is
given by <<BC3alpha>>.
