[[TRANSFER_CONVERSION]]
== Transfer functions

=== About transfer functions (informative)

The *transfer function* describes the mapping between a linear numerical
representation and a non-linear encoding.
The eye is more sensitive to relative light levels than absolute light
levels.
That is, if one image region is twice as bright as another, this will
be more visible than if one region is 10% brighter than another, even
if the absolute difference in brightness is the same in both cases.
To make use of the eye's non-linear response to light to provide better
image quality with a limited number of quantization steps, it is common
for color encodings to work with a non-linear representation which
dedicates a disproportionate number of bits to darker colors compared
with lighter colors.
The typical effect of this encoding is that mid-tones are stored with
a larger (nearer-to-white) numerical value than their actual brightness
would suggest, and that mid-values in the non-linear encoding typically
represent darker intensities than their fraction of the representation
of white would suggest.

.Conversion curves between linear light and encoded values (sRGB example)
image::images/tf_curves.{svgpdf}[width="{svgpdf@pdf:350pt:576}",align="center"]

The behavior has historically been approximated by a power function
with an exponent conventionally called latexmath:[$\gamma$]: +
{_R_,_G_,_B_}~non-linear~ = {_R_,_G_,_B_}~linear~^latexmath:[$\gamma$]^.
Hence this conversion is colloquially known as _gamma correction_.

NOTE: Many practical transfer functions incorporate a small linear
segment near 0, instead of being a pure power function.
This linearity reduces the required resolution for representing
the conversion, especially where results must be reversible, and
also reduces the noise sensitivity of the function in an analog
context.
When combined with a linear segment, the power function has a different
exponent from the pure power function that best approximates the
resulting curve.

<<<
A consequence of this non-linear encoding is that many image
processing operations should not be applied directly to the raw
non-linearly-encoded numbers, but require conversion back to a
linear representation.
For example, linear color gradients will appear distorted unless the
encoding is adjusted to compensate for the encoding; CGI lighting
calculations need linear intensity values for operation, and filtering
operations require texel intensities converted to linear form.

In the following example, the checker patterns are filtered in the
right-most square of each row by averaging the checker colors,
emulating a view of the pattern from a distance at which the
individual squares are no longer distinct.
The intended effect can be seen by viewing the diagram from a
distance, or deliberately out of focus.
The output is interpreted using the <<TRANSFER_SRGB,sRGB EOTF>>,
approximating the behavior of a CRT with uncorrected signals.
The background represents 50% gray.

.Averaging checker values with different transfer functions
image::images/tf_sampling.{svgpdf}[width="{svgpdf@pdf:210pt:576}",align="center"]

 * *In row 1* black (0.0) and white (1.0) texels are averaged to calculate
   a 0.5 value in the frame buffer.
   Due to the sRGB non-linearity, the appearance of the value 0.5 is darker
   than the average value of the black and white texels, so the gray box
   appears darker than the average intensity of the checker pattern.
 * *In row 2* the 0.5 average of the frame buffer is corrected using the
   sRGB (electro-optical) EOTF^&#160;-1^ to &sim;0.74.
   The gray box accordingly appears a good match for the average intensity
   of the black and white squares on most media.
 * *In row 3* the checker pattern instead represents values of 25% and
   75% of the light intensity (the average of which should be the same
   as the correct average of the black and white squares in the first two
   rows).
   These checker values have been converted to their non-linear
   representations, as might be the case for a texture in this format:
   the darker squares are represented by &sim;0.54, and
   the lighter squares are represented by &sim;0.88.
   Averaging these two values to get a value of 0.71 results in the
   right-most square: this appears slightly too dark compared with the
   correct representation of mid-gray (&sim;0.74) because,
   due to the non-linear encoding, the calculated value should not lie
   exactly half way between the two end points.
   Since the end points of the interpolation are less distant than the
   black and white case, the error is smaller than in the first example,
   and can more clearly be seen by comparing with the background gray.
 * *In row 4* the checker values have been converted using the
   EOTF to a linear representation which can be correctly interpolated,
   but the resulting output represents linear light, which is therefore
   interpreted as too dark by the non-linear display.
 * *In row 5* the results of row 4 have been converted back to the
   non-linear representation using the EOTF^&#160;-1^.
   The checker colors are restored to their correct values, and
   the interpolated value is now the correct average intensity of the
   two colors.

Incorrectly-applied transfer functions can also introduce color shifts,
as demonstrated by the saturation change in the following examples:

._R_, _G_, _B_ channels and combined color gradient with linear light intensity in each channel
image::images/tf_colorshift_intensitylinearvalues.png[width="{svgpdf@pdf:150pt:256}",align="center"]

<<<
A standard for image representation typically defines one or both of
two types of transfer functions:

.Opto-electronics and electro-optical transfer functions
image::images/tf_scene_store_display.{svgpdf}[width="{svgpdf@pdf:450pt:800}",align="center"]

 * An opto-electronic transfer function (OETF) defines the conversion
   between a normalized linear light intensity as recorded in the scene,
   and a non-linear electronic representation.
   Note that there is no requirement that this directly correspond to
   actual captured light: the content creator or scene capture hardware
   may adjust the apparent intensity compared to reality for aesthetic
   reasons, as though the colors (or lighting) of objects in the scene
   were similarly different from reality.
   For example, a camera may implement a roll-off function for
   highlights, and a content creator may introduce tone mapping
   to preserve shadow detail in the created content, with these
   being logically recorded as if the scene was actually modified
   accordingly.
   The inverse of the OETF (the conversion from the non-linear
   electronic representation to linear scene light) is written
   OETF^&#160;-1^(_n_).
 * An electro-optical transfer function (EOTF) converts between
   a non-linear electronic representation and a linear light
   normalized intensity as produced by the output display.
   The inverse of the EOTF (the conversion from linear display
   light to the non-linear electronic representation) is written
   EOTF^&#160;-1^(_n_).
   Typical CRT technology has implicitly applied a non-linear EOTF
   which coincidentally offered an approximately perceptually linear
   gradient when supplied with a linear voltage; other display
   technologies must implement the EOTF explicitly.
   As with the OETF, the EOTF describes a logical relationship that in
   reality will be modified by the viewer's aesthetic configuration
   choices and environment, and by the implementation choices of the
   display medium.
   Modern displays often incorporate proprietary variations from the
   reference intensity, particularly when mapping high dynamic range
   content to the capabilities of the hardware.

NOTE: Some color models derive chroma (color difference) channels
wholly or partly from non-linear intensities.
It is common for image representations which use these color models
to use a reduced-resolution representation of the chroma channels,
since the human eye is less sensitive to high resolution chroma
errors than to errors in brightness.
Despite the color shift introduced by interpolating non-linear values,
these chroma channels are typically resampled directly in their
native, non-linear representation.

The opto-optical transfer function (OOTF) of a system is the relationship
between linear input light intensity and displayed output light intensity:
OOTF(_input_) = EOTF(OETF(_input_)).
It is common for the OOTF to be non-linear.
For example, a brightly-lit scene rendered on a display that is viewed
in a dimly-lit room will typically appear washed-out and lacking contrast,
despite mapping the full range of scene brightness to the full range
supported by the display.
A non-linear OOTF can compensate for this by reducing the intensity of
mid-tones, which is why television standards typically assume a
non-linear OOTF: logical scene light intensity is not proportional to
logical display intensity.

<<<

In the following diagram, the upper pair of images are identical, as are
the lower pair of images (which have mid-tones darkened but the same maximum
brightness).
Adaptation to the surround means that the top left and lower right images
look similar.

.Simultaneous contrast
image::images/tf_surround_luminance.{svgpdf}[width="{svgpdf@pdf:450pt:800}",align="center"]

In the context of a non-linear OOTF, an application should be aware of whether
operations on the image are intended to reflect the representation of colors in
the scene or whether the intent is to represent the output color accurately,
at least when it comes to the transfer function applied.
For example, an application could choose to convert lighting calculations
from a linear to non-linear representation using the OETF (to match the
appearance of lighting in the scene), but to perform image scaling
operations using the EOTF in order to avoid introducing intensity shifts
due to filtering.
Working solely with the EOTF or OETF results in ignoring the intended OOTF of
the system.

In practice, the OOTF is usually near enough to linear that this distinction
is subtle and rarely worth making for computer graphics, especially since
computer-generated images may be designed to be viewed in brighter conditions
which would merit a linear OOTF, and since a lot of graphical content is
inherently not photo-realistic (or of limited realism, so that the transfer
functions are not the most important factor in suspending disbelief).
For video and photographic content viewed in darker conditions, the
non-linearity of the OOTF is significant.
The effect of a non-linear OOTF is usually secondary to the benefits of using
non-linear encoding to reduce quantization.

By convention, non-linearly-encoded values are distinguished from
linearly-encoded values by the addition of a prime (&prime;)
symbol. For example, (_R_,_G_,_B_) may represent a linear set of
red, green and blue components; (_R_&prime;,_G_&prime;,_B_&prime;)
would represent the non-linear encoding of each value. Typically
the non-linear encoding is applied to additive primary colors;
derived color differences may or may not retain the prime symbol.

[[TRANSFER_ITU]]
=== ITU transfer functions

NOTE: ``ITU'' is used in this context as a shorthand for the
OETF shared by the current <<bt601,BT.601>>, <<bt709,BT.709>> and
<<bt2020,BT.2020>> family of standard dynamic range digital
television production standards.
The same OETF is shared by <<smpte170m,SMPTE 170M>>.
The ITU does define other transfer functions, for example the
<<TRANSFER_PQ,PQ>> and <<TRANSFER_HLG,HLG>> transfer functions
described below (originating in <<bt2100,BT.2100>>) and the list
of EOTFs listed in <<bt470,BT.470-6>>.

==== ITU OETF

The ITU-T <<bt601,BT.601>>, <<bt709,BT.709>> and <<bt2020,BT.2020>>
specifications (for standard definition television, HDTV and UHDTV
respectively), and <<smpte170m,SMPTE 170M>>, which defines NTSC
broadcasts, define an opto-electrical transfer function.
The (OETF) conversion from linear (_R_,_G_,_B_) encoding
to non-linear (_R&prime;_,_G&prime;_,_B&prime;_) encoding is:

[latexmath]
++++++
\begin{align*}
\textit{R}' &= \begin{cases}
      \textit{R} \times 4.500, & \textit{R} < \beta \\
      \alpha \times \textit{R}^{0.45} - (\alpha - 1), & \textit{R} \geq \beta
  \end{cases} \\
\textit{G}' &= \begin{cases}
      \textit{G} \times 4.500, & \textit{G} < \beta \\
      \alpha \times \textit{G}^{0.45} - (\alpha - 1), & \textit{G} \geq \beta
  \end{cases} \\
\textit{B}' &= \begin{cases}
      \textit{B} \times 4.500, & \textit{B} < \beta \\
      \alpha \times \textit{B}^{0.45} - (\alpha - 1), & \textit{B} \geq \beta
  \end{cases}
\end{align*}
++++++

Where _&alpha;_ = 1.0993 and _&beta;_ = 0.0181
for 12-bit encoding in the BT.2020 specification, and
latexmath:[$\alpha = 1.099$] and latexmath:[$\beta = 0.018$] otherwise.

==== ITU OETF^&#160;-1^

From this the inverse (OETF^&#160;-1^) transformation can be deduced:

[latexmath]
++++++
\begin{align*}
\textit{R} &= \begin{cases}
      {{\textit{R}'}\over{4.500}}, & \textit{R}' < \delta \\
      {\left({\textit{R}' + (\alpha - 1)}\over{\alpha}\right)}^{1\over{0.45}}, & \textit{R}' \geq \delta
  \end{cases} \\
\textit{G} &= \begin{cases}
      {{\textit{G}'}\over{4.500}}, & \textit{G}' < \delta \\
      {\left({\textit{G}' + (\alpha - 1)}\over{\alpha}\right)}^{1\over{0.45}}, & \textit{G}' \geq \delta
  \end{cases} \\
B &= \begin{cases}
      {{\textit{B}'}\over{4.500}}, & \textit{B}' < \delta \\
      {\left({\textit{B}' + (\alpha - 1)}\over{\alpha}\right)}^{1\over{0.45}}, & \textit{B}' \geq \delta
  \end{cases}
\end{align*}
++++++

_&delta;_ can be deduced from _&alpha;_ {times} _&beta;_^0.45^
- (_&alpha;_ - 1) &#8776; 0.0812. Note that this is subtly different from
4.5 {times} _&beta;_ due to rounding. See the following section
for the derivation of these values.

<<smpte170m,SMPTE 170M-2004>>, which defines the behavior of NTSC
televisions, defines the EOTF of the ``reference reproducer'' as the
OETF^&#160;-1^ function above, with _&delta;_ explicitly
written as 0.0812.
Therefore the SMPTE 170M-2004 EOTF^&#160;-1^ equals the OETF given above.
The ``reference camera'' of SMTPE 170M-2004 has an OETF function matching
that of the ITU specifications.
That is, the OOTF of the system described in SMPTE 170M-2004 provides a
linear mapping of captured scene intensity to display intensity: the SMPTE
170M-2004 OETF is described as being chosen to result in a linear OOTF
on a typical display.
This is distinct from the current ITU specifications, which assume a
non-linear OOTF.
SMPTE 170M-2004 also represents a change from the ``assumed gamma'' of
2.2 associated with most NTSC display devices as described in
<<bt470,ITU-T BT.470-6>> and <<bt2043,BT.2043>>, although these
standards also define a linear OOTF.

<<<
This ``ITU'' OETF is closely approximated by a simple power function with
an exponent of 0.5 (and therefore the OETF^&#160;-1^ is quite closely
approximated by a simple power function with an exponent of 2.0);
the linear segment and offset mean that the best match is _not_ the
exponent of 0.45 that forms part of the exact equation.
ITU standards deliberately chose a different transfer curve from that of a
typical CRT in order to introduce a non-linear OOTF, as a means to compensate
for the typically dim conditions in which a television is viewed.
<<bt2087,ITU BT.2087>> refers to the approximation of the OETF with a
square root latexmath:[$\left(\gamma = {1\over{2}}\right)$] function.

The following graph shows the close relationship between the ITU OETF
(shown in red) and a pure power function with
latexmath:[$\gamma={1\over{2}}$] (in blue).
The difference between the curves is shown in black.
The largest difference between the curve values at the same point when
quantized to 8 bits is 15, mostly due to the sharp vertical gradient
near 0.

[NOTE]
====
<<smpte170m,SMPTE 170M-2004>> contains a note that the OETF is a more ``technically
correct'' definition of the transfer function, and compares it to a ``transfer
gradient (gamma exponent) of 2.2'' in previous specifications, and that the
OETF in older documents is described as ``1/2.2 (0.455...)''.
While both versions define a linear OOTF, there is no explicit mention that
curve has substantially changed; this might be due to conflation of the 0.455
exponent in older specifications with the 0.45 exponent in the new formulae.
The ITU OETF is actually a closer match to a gamma exponent of
latexmath:[$1\over{2.0}$], as shown above; it is a relatively poor match to a
gamma exponent of latexmath:[$1\over{2.2}$]; the following graph shows the
difference between the ITU OETF (shown in red) and a pure power function
with latexmath:[$\gamma={1\over{2.2}}$] (in blue).
The difference between the curves is shown in black.

==== Derivation of the ITU alpha and beta constants (informative)

Using the 12-bit encoding values for _&alpha;_ and _&beta;_
from <<bt2020,Rec.2020>>, there is an overlap around a non-linear value of 0.08145.
In other cases, the conversion from linear to non-linear representation with
encoding introduces a discontinuity between
(0.018&nbsp;{times}&nbsp;4.500)&nbsp;=&nbsp;0.081 and
(1.099&nbsp;{times}&nbsp;0.018^0.45^&nbsp;-&nbsp;0.099)&nbsp;&#8776;&nbsp;0.0812,
corresponding to roughly a single level in a 12-bit range.
<<smpte170m,SMPTE 170M-2004>> provides formulae for both transformations and uses
0.0812 as a case selector for the non-linear-to-linear transformation.

The values of _&alpha;_ and _&beta;_ in the ITU function
were apparently chosen such that the linear segment and power segment meet at the
same value and with the same derivative (that is, the linear segment meets the
power segment at a tangent).
The _&alpha;_ and _&beta;_ values can be derived as follows:

At {_R_,_G_,_B_}&nbsp;= _&beta;_, the linear and non-linear segments of the curve
must calculate the same value:

[latexmath]
++++++
$$4.5 \times \beta = \alpha \times \beta^{0.45} - (\alpha - 1)$$
++++++

Additionally, the derivatives of the linear and non-linear segments of the curve
must match:

[latexmath]
++++++
$$4.5 = 0.45 \times \alpha \times \beta^{-0.55}$$
++++++

The derivative can be rearranged to give the equation:

[latexmath]
++++++
$$\alpha = 10 \times \beta^{0.55}$$
++++++

Substituting this into the original equation results in the following:

[latexmath]
++++++
$$4.5 \times \beta = 10 \times \beta^{0.55} \times \beta^{0.45} - (10 \times \beta^{0.55} - 1)$$
++++++

This simplifies to:

[latexmath]
++++++
$$5.5 \times \beta - 10 \times \beta^{0.55} + 1 = 0$$
++++++

This can be solved numerically (for example by Newton-Raphson iteration),
and results in values of:

[latexmath]
++++++
\begin{align*}
\beta &\approx 0.018053968510808\\
\alpha &\approx 1.099296826809443\\
\delta &= \alpha\times\beta^{0.45} - (\alpha-1) = 4.5\times\beta\\
&\approx 0.081242858298635\\

[[TRANSFER_SRGB_EOTFVSGAMMA]]
==== sRGB EOTF vs gamma 2.2

The sRGB EOTF approximates a simple power function with an
exponent of 2.2, which is intended to be consistent with legacy CRT
content, particularly for <<TRANSFER_LEGACY_NTSC,NTSC>> devices, and to
approximate the expected EOTF for <<TRANSFER_ITU,BT.709>> content,
given the implicit OOTF used in production video content.
sRGB is distinct from <<TRANSFER_1886,ITU-T BT.1886>>, which offers
a (different) reference EOTF for flat panels used for HDTV and is
also intended to complement BT.709; in addition to the change in
EOTF, sRGB specifies a reference display maximum luminance of 80cd/m^2^,
compared with 100cd/m^2^ for BT.1886.
sRGB is also distinct from <<smpte170m,SMPTE 170M>>, which defines
its EOTF as the inverse of its (and BT.709's) OETF.

<<<
The following graph compares the sRGB EOTF (in red) and a pure power
function with latexmath:[$\gamma=2.2$] (in blue); the area between the
two curves is shown in black.
The largest non-linear difference at the same linear value when
quantized to 8 bits is 3.

.sRGB EOTF vs pure gamma 2.2
image::images/tf_srgbvsgamma.png[width="{svgpdf@pdf:192pt:257}",align="center"]

NOTE: The sRGB standard assumes a quantization scheme in which
0.0 is represented by the value 0 and 1.0 is represented by 255.
Despite the goal of complementing <<bt709,ITU-T Rec. BT.709>>,
this is different from the ITU ``full-range'' encoding scheme
defined in <<bt2100,ITU-T Rec. BT.2100>>, which represents 1.0 as
a power of two (not latexmath:[$2^n-1$]) and therefore cannot exactly
represent 1.0.

The following graph shows the relationship between the sRGB EOTF (shown in red)
and the <<TRANSFER_ITU,ITU OETF>> (shown in blue).
The result of applying the two functions in turn, resulting in the OOTF of a combined
ITU-sRGB system, is shown in black. Since the sRGB EOTF approximates a power function
with latexmath:[$\gamma=2.2$] and the ITU OETF approximates a power function with
latexmath:[$\gamma=2.0$], also shown in green is the resulting OOTF corresponding to a
power function with latexmath:[$\gamma={2.2\over{2.0}}=1.1$].

The original sRGB specification was defined only in terms of positive
values between 0 and 1.
Subsequent standards, such as <<scrgb,scRGB>> annex B, use the same transfer
function but expand the range to incorporate values less than 0 and greater
than 1.0.
In these cases, when the input channel to the conversion is negative,
the output should be the negative version of the conversion applied to
the absolute value of the input.

is unlikely to be significant in most applications.

<<scrgb,sYCC>> includes a hint that a 1cd/m^2^ level of flare should

E'_{sRGB} &= (\textrm{non-linear}) \{R'_{sRGB},G'_{sRGB},B'_{sRGB}\}

This is equivalent to applying
latexmath:[$E_{sYCC} = 0.0125 + {1\over 1-0.0125} \times E_{sRGB}$]
to linear latexmath:[$\{R,G,B\}$] values.
The resulting linear latexmath:[$E_{sYCC}$] values then need to be

[[TRANSFER_SRGB_DERIVED]]
==== Derivation of the sRGB constants (informative)

Similar to the ITU transfer function, the EOTF^&#160;-1^ of the sRGB function
can be written as:

[latexmath]
++++++
\begin{align*}
\{R,G,B\} &= \begin{cases}
      \{R',G',B'\} \times 12.92, & \{R',G',B'\} \leq \beta \\
      \alpha \times \{R',G',B'\}^{1\over{2.4}} - (\alpha - 1), & \{R',G',B'\} < \beta
  \end{cases}
\end{align*}
++++++

Like the ITU transfer function above, the values of latexmath:[$\alpha$]
and latexmath:[$\beta$] in the sRGB function appear to have been chosen
such that the linear segment and power segment meet at the same value and
with the same derivative (that is, the linear segment meets the power
segment at a tangent).
The latexmath:[$\alpha$] and latexmath:[$\beta$] values can be derived as
follows:

At latexmath:[$\{R',G',B'\} = \beta$], the linear and non-linear segments
of the function must calculate the same value:

[latexmath]
++++++
$$12.92 \times \beta = \alpha \times \beta^{1\over{2.4}} - (\alpha - 1)$$
++++++

Additionally, the derivatives of the linear and non-linear segments of
the function must match:

[latexmath]
++++++
$$12.92 = {{\alpha \times \beta^{{1\over{2.4}}-1}}\over{2.4}}$$
++++++

This formula can be rearranged to give latexmath:[$\alpha$] in terms of
latexmath:[$\beta$]:

[latexmath]
++++++
$$\alpha = 12.92\times 2.4\times \beta^{1-{1\over{2.4}}}$$
++++++

Substituting this into the formula for latexmath:[$\{R,G,B\}$]:

[latexmath]
++++++
$$12.92 \times \beta = 12.92\times 2.4\times \beta^{1-{1\over{2.4}}} \times \beta^{1\over{2.4}} - (12.92\times 2.4\times \beta^{1-{1\over{2.4}}} - 1)$$
++++++

This equation simplifies to:

[latexmath]
++++++
$$1.4 \times 12.92 \times \beta - 2.4 \times 12.92 \times \beta^{1 - {1\over{2.4}}} + 1 = 0$$
+++++

This can be further simplified to:

[latexmath]
++++++
$$1.4 \times \beta - 2.4 \times \beta^{1 - {1\over{2.4}}} + {1\over{12.92}} = 0$$
+++++

The value of latexmath:[$\beta$] can be found numerically (for example by
Newton-Raphson iteration, with a derivative of
latexmath:[$1.4-1.4\beta^{-{1\over{2.4}}}$]), and results in values of:

[latexmath]
++++++
\begin{align*}
\beta &\approx  0.003041282560128\\
\alpha &\approx 1.055010718947587\\
\delta &= 12.92\times\beta = \alpha\times\beta^{1\over{2.4}}-(\alpha-1.0)\\
&\approx 0.039293370676848
\end{align*}
++++++

Where latexmath:[$\delta$] is the value of the EOTF^&#160;-1^ at
latexmath:[$\{R',G',B'\} = \beta$].

[NOTE]
====
These deduced values are appreciably different from those in the sRGB
specification, which does not state the origin of its constants.
The intersection point of the sRGB EOTF has less numerical stability
(and more nearby local minima in curves being optimized) that the
corresponding ITU function - it is sensitive to the start value used
for numerical approximations.
This may explain how different values were reached for the sRGB
specification.
However, the errors both in value and derivative at the point of
selection between the linear and exponent segments are small in
practice.
====

The EOTF can be written with these derived values as:

[latexmath]
++++++
  $$\{R,G,B\} = \begin{cases}
      {{\{R',G',B'\}}\over{12.92}}, & \{R',G',B'\} \leq \delta \\
      \left({{\{R',G',B'\}}\over{\alpha}} + {{\alpha-1}\over\alpha}\right)^{2.4}, & \{R',G',B'\} > \delta
  \end{cases}$$
++++++

[NOTE]
====
Apple describes the <<dcip3,Display P3 color space>> as using the
sRGB transfer function.
The profile viewer in Apple's ColorSync utility reports that
the EOTF is of the following form:

[latexmath]
++++++
  $$f(x) = \begin{cases}
  cx, & x < d \\
  (ax+b)^\gamma, & x \geq d
  \end{cases}$$
++++++

The reported figures for latexmath:[$\gamma=2.4,\ a=0.948,\ b=0.52$]
and latexmath:[$c=0.077$] correspond to the equivalent values in
the sRGB specification:

[latexmath]
++++++
\begin{align*}
{1\over{\alpha}} &\approx 0.948 = a\\
{{\alpha-1}\over\alpha} &\approx 0.52 = b\\
{1\over{12.92}} &\approx 0.077 = c
\end{align*}
++++++

These values are correct to the reported precision both for the value
latexmath:[$\alpha = 1.055$] in the sRGB specification and for the more
precise latexmath:[$\alpha \approx 1.055010718947587$] derived above.

&#160;

However, where the sRGB specification states that
latexmath:[$\delta = 0.04045$], the profile viewer reports
a corresponding d&#160;=&#160;0.039.
The disparity can be explained if the profile values have been
derived as described in this section:

[latexmath]
++++++
$$\delta \approx 0.039293370676848\approx 0.039 = d$$
++++++

Note that this value assumes a correspondingly corrected version
of latexmath:[$\alpha$] rather than latexmath:[$a = 1.055$].

&#160;

The extra precision may be needed over the constants in the sRGB
specification due to the use of additional bits of accuracy in the
Display P3 representation, which may expose a discontinuity due to
rounding with the original numbers, particularly in the gradient of
the curve.
However, this distinction is subtle: when calculated over a [0..1]
range, the derived EOTF and EOTF^&#160;-1^ agree with the official
sRGB formulae to greater than 16-bit precision.
====

Without allowing for adjusting the latexmath:[$\alpha = 1.055$]
constant in the sRGB formula, the power function cannot be made
to intersect perfectly at a tangent to the linear segment with
gradient of 12.92.
However, the intersection point latexmath:[$\beta$] can be
found by solving:

[latexmath]
++++++
$$1.055\times\beta^{1\over{2.4}}-12.92\times\beta-0.055 = 0$$
++++++

This equation can give us a slightly more precise pair of values
for the original sRGB equation:

[latexmath]
++++++
\begin{align*}
\beta &\approx 0.003130668 \\
\delta &\approx 0.040448236
\end{align*}
++++++

In practice this makes no measurable difference, but does suggest
that the values of latexmath:[$\beta = 0.0031308$] in the sRGB
specification may have been incorrectly rounded.

\end{align*}
++++++

<<bt2087,ITU BT.2087>> proposes the use of a simple power function with a
latexmath:[$\gamma = 2.4$] as an approximation to this EOTF for the purposes
of color conversion, effectively assuming _b_ = 0 and _L~B~_ is pure black.
The reference display described in BT.1886 has a maximum luminance level of
100cd/m^2^ (brighter than the equivalent <<TRANSFER_SRGB,sRGB>> reference
display).

The following graph shows the relationship between the BT.1886 EOTF (shown in red)
and the <<TRANSFER_ITU,ITU OETF>> such as used for <<bt709,BT.709>> (shown in blue).
The result of applying the two functions in turn, resulting in the OOTF of a combined

function with latexmath:[$\gamma=2.0$], also shown in green is the resulting OOTF
corresponding to a power function with latexmath:[$\gamma={2.4\over{2.0}}=1.2$].

[NOTE]
====
No explanation for the choice of [0..12] range in the official version of
the formula is explicitly offered in BT.2100-0 (it does _not_, for example,
appear to relate to the <<bt1886,BT.1886>> OOTF latexmath:[$\gamma = 1.2$]
combined with the latexmath:[$10\times$] ratio between the
<<bt2100,1000>>cd/m^2^ of a standard HLG HDR TV and the <<bt1886,100>>cd/m^2^
of a standard dynamic range set).
However, allowing for the difference in the maximum display brightness of
HDR and SDR systems there is deliberate (scaled) compatibility between the HLG
OETF and the <<TRANSFER_ITU,BT.2020 OETF>> (which itself approximates a square
root function) over much of the encodable dynamic range of a BT.2020 system.
Since HDR content is intended to support accurate highlights more than
to maintain a higher persistent screen brightness (many HDR displays can
only support maximum brightness in a small area or over a small period
without overheating), agreement over a significant chunk of the tone curve
allows a simple adaptation between HDR and SDR devices: fed HLG-encoded
content, an SDR display may represent darker tones accurately and simply
under-represent highlights.
The origins of both HLG and PQ are discussed in <<bt2390,ITU-R BT.2390>>.

&#160;

As graphed in <<bt2390,ITU-R BT.2390>>, the ``unnormalized'' HLG OETF (red)
is a good approximation to the standard dynamic range ITU transfer function
(blue, output scaled by 0.5) up to latexmath:[$E \approx 1$] and
latexmath:[$\textrm{OETF}(E) = E' \approx 0.5$], with a smooth
curve up to the maximum HLG representable scene light value of ``12'':

==== HLG OOTF

The OOTF of HLG is described as:

[latexmath]
+++++
\begin{align*}
R_D &= \alpha\times Y_S^{\gamma-1}\times R_S + \beta \\
G_D &= \alpha\times Y_S^{\gamma-1}\times G_S + \beta \\
B_D &= \alpha\times Y_S^{\gamma-1}\times B_S + \beta \\
\end{align*}
+++++

where _R~D~_, _G~D~_ and _B~D~_ describe the luminance of the displayed
linear component in cd/m^2^ and _R~S~_, _G~S~_ and _B~S~_ describe each
color component in scene linear light, scaled by camera exposure and
normalized to the representable range.

NOTE: BT.2100 notes that some legacy displays apply the
latexmath:[$\gamma$] function to each channel separately, rather than
to the luminance component.
That is,
latexmath:[$\{R_D,G_D,B_D\}=\alpha\times\{R_S,G_S,B_S\}^\gamma+\beta$].
This is an approximation to the official OOTF.

_Y~S~_ is the normalized scene luminance, defined as:

[latexmath]
+++++
$$Y_S = 0.2627\times R_S + 0.6780\times G_S + 0.0593\times B_S$$
+++++

latexmath:[$\beta$] represents the black level (display ``brightness''):

[latexmath]
+++++
$$\beta = L_B$$
+++++

latexmath:[$\alpha$] represents the black level (display ``contrast''):

[width="70%",options="header",cols="1,5,5"]
|============
| | Scene light normalized to [0..1] | Scene light normalized to [0..12]
| latexmath:[$\alpha$] | latexmath:[${L_W - L_B}$] | latexmath:[${{L_W - L_B}\over{\left(12\right)^\gamma}}$]
|============

_L~W~_ is the nominal peak luminance of the display in cd/m^2^, and
_L~B~_ is the display luminance of black in cd/m^2^.

[NOTE]
====
<<bt2100,BT.2100>>-1 (the current version at the time of writing)
includes an apparent typographical error in its definition of the
OOTF, providing both the equation with scene light normalized
to the range [0..1] and the (legacy) <<TRANSFER_HLG_IOETF_UNNORM,
equation with scene light normalized to the range [0..12]>>, without
explanation.
====

latexmath:[$\gamma = 1.2$] for a nominal peak display luminance of 1000cd/m^2^.
For displays with higher peak luminance or if peak luminance is reduced through
a contrast control,
latexmath:[$\gamma = 1.2 + 0.42\times \textrm{log}_{10}\left({L_W\over 1000}\right)$].

For the purposes of general conversion, _L~W~_ can be assumed to be
1000cd/m^2^, and _L~B~_ can be approximated as 0, removing the constant
offset from the above equations and meaning latexmath:[$\gamma=1.2$].

==== HLG EOTF

The EOTF of BT.2100 HLG is defined in terms of the OETF and OOTF
defined above:

[latexmath]
+++++
\begin{align*}
R_D &= \alpha\times Y_S^{\gamma-1}\times R_S + \beta \\
G_D &= \alpha\times Y_S^{\gamma-1}\times G_S + \beta \\

==== HLG OOTF^&#160;-1^

Using the formula from the OOTF leads to the following relationship
between _Y~D~_ and _Y~S~_:

[latexmath]
+++++
\begin{align*}
Y_D =& 0.2627\times R_D + 0.6780\times G_D + 0.0593\times B_D \\
=& 0.2627\times(\alpha\times Y_S^{\gamma-1}\times R_S + \beta) +
0.6780\times(\alpha\times Y_S^{\gamma-1}\times G_S + \beta) +
0.0593\times(\alpha\times Y_S^{\gamma-1}\times B_S + \beta) \\
=& \alpha\times Y_S^{\gamma-1}\times(0.2627\times R_S
+ 0.6780\times G_S + 0.0593\times B_S)+\beta \\
=& \alpha\times Y_S^{\gamma}+\beta \\
\therefore Y_S =& \left({{Y_D-\beta}\over\alpha}\right)^{1\over\gamma}\\
Y_S^{1-\gamma} =& \left({{Y_D-\beta}\over\alpha}\right)^{(1-\gamma)/\gamma}
\end{align*}
+++++

From this, the following relations can be derived:
[latexmath]
+++++
\begin{align*}
R_S &= {(R_D - \beta)\over{\alpha\times Y_S^{\gamma-1}}}
= Y_S^{1-\gamma}\times{{(R_D-\beta)}\over\alpha}
= \left({{Y_D - \beta}\over\alpha}\right)^{(1-\gamma)/\gamma} \times
    \left({{R_D - \beta}\over{\alpha}}\right) \\
G_S &= {(G_D - \beta)\over{\alpha\times Y_S^{\gamma-1}}}
= Y_S^{1-\gamma}\times{{(G_D-\beta)}\over\alpha}
= \left({{Y_D - \beta}\over\alpha}\right)^{(1-\gamma)/\gamma} \times
    \left({{G_D - \beta}\over{\alpha}}\right) \\
B_S &= {(B_D - \beta)\over{\alpha\times Y_S^{\gamma-1}}}
= Y_S^{1-\gamma}\times{{(B_D-\beta)}\over\alpha}
= \left({{Y_D - \beta}\over\alpha}\right)^{(1-\gamma)/\gamma} \times
    \left({{B_D - \beta}\over{\alpha}}\right)
\end{align*}
+++++

For processing without knowledge of the display, latexmath:[$\alpha$]
can be treated as 1.0cd/m^2^ and latexmath:[$\beta$] can be considered
to be 0.0cd/m^2^.
This simplifies the equations as follows:

[latexmath]
+++++
\begin{align*}
Y_S &= Y_D^{1/\gamma} \\
Y_S^{1-\gamma} &= Y_D^{(1/\gamma)-1} \\
R_S&=Y_D^{(1/\gamma)-1}\times R_D \\
G_S&=Y_D^{(1/\gamma)-1}\times G_D \\
B_S&=Y_D^{(1/\gamma)-1}\times B_D

[[TRANSFER_PQ]]

NOTE: Unlike <<TRANSFER_HLG,BT.2100 HLG>> and other <<TRANSFER_ITU,ITU>>

EOTF (mapping from the encoded values to the display output), not an OETF

+++++

latexmath:[$E'$] is a non-linear color channel latexmath:[$\{R',G',B'\}$] or
latexmath:[$\{L',M',S'\}$] encoded as PQ in the range [0..1]. +
latexmath:[$F_D$] is the luminance of the displayed component in cd/m^2^
(where the luminance of an latexmath:[$\{R_D,G_D,B_D\}$] or latexmath:[$Y_D$]
or latexmath:[$I_D$] component is considered to be the luminance of the
color with all channels set to the same value as the component). +
When latexmath:[$R'=G'=B'$] the displayed pixel is monochromatic. +

==== PQ OOTF

The OOTF of PQ matches that of <<TRANSFER_BT1886,BT.1886>>'s EOTF combined
with <<TRANSFER_ITU,BT.709>>'s OETF:

[latexmath]
+++++
$$F_D = \textrm{OOTF}(E) = \textrm{G}_{1886}(\textrm{G}_{709}(E))$$
+++++

where _E_ is one of latexmath:[$\{R_S,G_S,B_S,Y_S,I_S\}$], the linear
representation of scene light scaled by camera exposure and in the range
[0..1], G~1886~ is the EOTF described in <<TRANSFER_BT1886,BT.1886>>, and
G~709~ is the OETF described in <<TRANSFER_ITU,BT.709>> with a scale factor
of 59.5208 applied to _E_:

267.84\times E, & 0.0003024 \geq E \geq 0
\end{cases}
\end{align*}
+++++

[NOTE]
====
<<bt2390,ITU-R BT.2390>> explains the derivation of the scale factor:

&#160;

PQ can encode 100 times the display brightness of a standard dynamic
range (``SDR'') encoding (10000cd/m^2^ compared with the 100cd/m^2^
SDR reference display described in <<bt1886,BT.1886>>).
High dynamic range (HDR) displays are intended to represent the
majority of scene content within a ``standard'' dynamic range, and
exposure of a normalized SDR signal is chosen to provide suitable
exposure.
HDR displays offer extra capability for representation of small
or transient highlights (few HDR displays can actually reach the
maximum 10000cd/m^2^ encodable brightness, and few HDR displays can
maintain their maximum intensity over a large area for an extended
period without overheating).
Therefore the behavior of HDR displays is intended to approximate
a conventional standard dynamic range display for most of the image,
while retaining the ability to encode extreme values.

&#160;

As described in BT.2390, the OOTF of SDR is roughly
latexmath:[$\gamma = 1.2$] (deviating from this curve more near a 0 value),
so the maximum _scene_ light intensity that can be represented is roughly
latexmath:[$100^{1\over 1.2} \approx 46.42$] times that of a SDR encoding.

&#160;

Using exact equations from <<bt709,BT.709>> and <<bt1886,BT.1886>>
to create the OOTF, rather than the latexmath:[$\gamma = 1.2$]
approximation, the maximum representable scene brightness, if 1.0 is the
maximum normalized SDR brightness is:

[latexmath]
+++++
\begin{align*}
\left({100^{1\over 2.4} + 0.099\over 1.099}\right)^{1\over 0.45} &\approx 59.5208
\end{align*}
+++++

The other constants in the G~709~ formula are derived as follows:

[latexmath]
+++++
\begin{align*}
{0.018\over 59.5208} &\approx 0.0003024 \\
4.5\times 59.5208 &\approx 267.84
\end{align*}
+++++

Note that these constants differ slightly if the more accurate
latexmath:[$\alpha = 1.0993$] figure from <<bt2020,BT.2020>> is used
instead of 1.099.

==== PQ OETF

The OETF of PQ is described in terms of the above OOTF:

[[TRANSFER_DCIP3]]
=== DCI P3 transfer functions

<<dcip3,DCI P3>> defines a simple power function with an exponent of 2.6
(applied to scaled CIE _XYZ_ values).

That is:

[latexmath]
+++++
\begin{align*}
  X' &= \left({X\over{52.37}}\right)^{1\over{2.6}}\\
  Y' &= \left({Y\over{52.37}}\right)^{1\over{2.6}}\\
  Z' &= \left({Z\over{52.37}}\right)^{1\over{2.6}}\\
  X &= X'^{2.6}\times 52.37\\
  Y &= Y'^{2.6}\times 52.37\\
  Z &= Z'^{2.6}\times 52.37\\
\end{align*}
+++++

This power function is applied directly to scaled CIE _XYZ_ color
coordinates: the ``primaries'' in DCI define the bounds of the gamut,
but the actual color encoding uses _XYZ_ coordinates.
DCI scales the resulting non-linear values to the range [0..4095]
prior to quantization, rounding to nearest.

NOTE: ``Display P3'' uses the <<TRANSFER_SRGB,sRGB transfer function>>,
modified in some implementations to have more accurate constants (see the
section on the derivation of the sRGB constants).

[[TRANSFER_LEGACY_NTSC]]
=== Legacy NTSC transfer functions

<<bt470,ITU-R BT.470-6>>, which has now been deprecated, lists a number of
regional TV standard variants; an updated list of variant codes used by country
is defined in <<bt2043,ITU-R BT.2043>>.
This standard, along with <<cfr,e-CFR title 47 section 73.682>>, documents a
simple EOTF power function with latexmath:[$\gamma = 2.2$] for NTSC display
devices.

[latexmath]
+++++
\begin{align*}
R' &= R^{1\over{2.2}} \\
G' &= G^{1\over{2.2}} \\
B' &= B^{1\over{2.2}} \\
R &= R'^{2.2} \\
G &= G'^{2.2} \\
B &= B'^{2.2}
\end{align*}
+++++

This value of latexmath:[$\gamma$] is also used for N/PAL signals in the
Eastern Republic of Uruguay, and was also adopted by <<st240,ST-240>>.

Combined with the reference in <<smpte170m,SMPTE 170M>> to a
latexmath:[$\gamma = 2.2$] being used in ``older documents'', this
suggests a linear design OOTF for NTSC systems.

<<bt1700,ITU-R BT.1700>>, which partly replaced BT.470, also describes an
``assumed gamma of display device'' of 2.2 for PAL and SECAM systems;
this is distinct from the latexmath:[$\gamma = 2.8$] value listed in
<<bt470,ITU-R BT.470-6>>.
Combined with the <<TRANSFER_ITU,ITU OETF>> which approximates
latexmath:[$\gamma = {1\over{2.0}}$], the PAL OOTF retains a
latexmath:[$\gamma \approx 1.1$] when this value of
latexmath:[$\gamma = 2.2$] is used for the EOTF, similar to the figure
described under <<TRANSFER_LEGACY_PAL_EOTF,the legacy PAL EOTF>>.

In contrast, <<bt1700,ITU-R BT.1700>> also includes
<<smpte170m,SMPTE 170m>>, which defines the assumed EOTF of the display
device as being the inverse of the current <<TRANSFER_ITU,ITU OETF>>.
Hence the new NTSC formulation also assumes a linear OOTF.

[[TRANSFER_LEGACY_PAL_OETF]]
=== Legacy PAL OETF

<<bt472,ITU-R BT.472>>, ``Video-frequency characteristics of a television
system to be used for the international exchange of programmes between
countries that have adopted 625-line colour or monochrome systems'', defines
that the ``gamma of the picture signal'' should be ``approximately 0.4''.
The reciprocal of this value is 2.5.

That is, this standard defines an approximate OETF and OETF^&#160;-1^ for
PAL content:

[latexmath]
+++++
\begin{align*}
R' &\approx R^{0.4} \\
G' &\approx G^{0.4} \\
B' &\approx B^{0.4} \\
R  &\approx R'^{2.5} \\
G  &\approx G'^{2.5} \\
B  &\approx B'^{2.5}
\end{align*}
+++++

[[TRANSFER_LEGACY_PAL_EOTF]]
=== Legacy PAL 625-line EOTF

<<bt470,ITU-R BT.470-6>>, which has now been deprecated in favor of BT.1700,
lists a number of regional TV standard variants; an updated list of variant
codes used by country is defined in <<bt2043,ITU-R BT.2043>>.

This specification describes a simple EOTF power function with
latexmath:[$\gamma_{\textrm{EOTF}} = 2.8$] for most PAL and SECAM display devices:

[latexmath]
+++++
\begin{align*}
R' &\approx R^{1\over{2.8}} \\
G' &\approx G^{1\over{2.8}} \\
B' &\approx B^{1\over{2.8}} \\
R  &\approx R'^{2.8} \\
G  &\approx G'^{2.8} \\
B  &\approx B'^{2.8}
\end{align*}
+++++

NOTE: Poynton describes a latexmath:[$\gamma$] of 2.8 as being ``unrealistically
high'' for actual CRT devices.

Combined with the <<TRANSFER_LEGACY_PAL_EOTF,corresponding legacy EOTF>> with
latexmath:[$\gamma_{\textrm{EOTF}} = 0.4$], the described system OOTF is:

[latexmath]
+++++
\begin{align*}
R_{display} &\approx R_{scene}^{2.8\over{2.5}}\\
G_{display} &\approx G_{scene}^{2.8\over{2.5}}\\
B_{display} &\approx B_{scene}^{2.8\over{2.5}}
\end{align*}
+++++

Or latexmath:[$\gamma_{\textrm{OOTF}} \approx 1.12$].

The value of latexmath:[$\gamma_{\textrm{EOTF}} = 2.8$] is described in BT.470-6 as being
chosen for ``an overall system gamma'' (OOTF power function exponent) of
``approximately 1.2''; this suggests that the ``approximately 0.4'' exponent in
<<bt472,BT.472-6>> should be interpreted as nearer to latexmath:[${1.2\over{2.8}}
\approx 0.43$], or at least that there was enough variation in early devices for
precise formulae to be considered irrelevant.

[NOTE]
====
The EOTF power function of latexmath:[$\gamma_{\textrm{EOTF}} = 2.2$] described in
<<bt1700,BT.1700>> combines with the <<TRANSFER_ITU,ITU OETF>> described in
<<bt601,BT.601>> (which approximates latexmath:[$\gamma_{\textrm{OETF}} \approx 0.5$])
to give a similar system latexmath:[$\gamma_{\textrm{OOTF}} \approx 1.1$].
As described <<TRANSFER_BT1886,above>>, the <<TRANSFER_ITU,ITU OETF>>
combined with the <<bt1886,BT.1886>> EOTF results in a more strongly non-linear
latexmath:[$\gamma_{\textrm{OOTF}} \approx {2.4\over{2.0}} = 1.2$].

[[TRANSFER_ST240]]
=== ST240/SMPTE240M transfer functions

The <<st240,ST-240>>, formerly SMPTE240M, interim standard for HDTV defines the

Like <<smpte170m,SMPTE170m>>, ST-240 defines a linear OOTF.

[[TRANSFER_ADOBERGB]]
=== Adobe RGB (1998) transfer functions

The <<adobergb,Adobe RGB (1998) specification>> defines the following transfer
function (notable for not including a linear component):

[latexmath]
+++++
\begin{align*}
R &= R'^{2.19921875} \\
G &= G'^{2.19921875} \\
B &= B'^{2.19921875}
\end{align*}
+++++

2.19921875 is obtained from latexmath:[$2{51\over{256}}$] or hexadecimal 2.33.
Therefore the inverse transfer function is:

[latexmath]
+++++
\begin{align*}
R' &= R^{256\over{563}} \\
G' &= G^{256\over{563}} \\
B' &= B^{256\over{563}}
\end{align*}

[[TRANSFER_SLOG]]
=== Sony S-Log transfer functions

The Sony <<slog,S-Log>> OETF is defined for each color channel as:

[latexmath]
+++++
$$y = (0.432699 \times \textrm{log}_{10}(t + 0.037584) + 0.616596) + 0.03$$
+++++

Linear camera input scaled by exposure _t_ ranges from 0 to 10.0;
_y_ is the non-linear encoded value.

The OETF^&#160;-1^ is:

[latexmath]
+++++
$$Y = 10.0^{t - 0.616596 - 0.03\over 0.432699} - 0.037584$$
+++++

The encoded non-linear value _t_ ranges from 0 to 1.09; _Y_ is the
linear scene light.

[[TRANSFER_SLOG2]]

<<slog,S-Log2>> defines the following OETF:

[latexmath]
+++++
\begin{align*}
y &= \begin{cases}
(0.432699\times\textrm{log}_{10}\left({155.0\times x\over 219.0} + 0.037584\right) + 0.616596 + 0.03, &x \geq 0 \\
x \times 3.53881278538813 + 0.030001222851889303, &x < 0
\end{cases}
\end{align*}
+++++

_x_ is the IRE in scene-linear space. +
_y_ is the IRE in S-Log2 space.

The OETF^&#160;-1^ is:

[latexmath]
+++++
\begin{align*}
y &= \begin{cases}
{219.0 \times 10.0^{x - 0.616596 - 0.03\over 0.432699}\over 155.0}, &x \geq 0.030001222851889303 \\
